Quick start instructions for running this PHP project locally (XAMPP / Windows).

## Installation

1. Install XAMPP (Apache + MySQL) and Composer on Windows.
2. Place the project in XAMPP's htdocs (example path used here):
   - C:\xampp\htdocs\uiu-nexus
     
## Database setup

1. Start XAMPP Apache and MySQL.
2. Import the canonical SQL dump:
   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\uiu-nexus\nexus.sql
   ```

## Usage

- Using XAMPP:
  - Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
  - Open the app in a browser:
    - http://localhost/uiu-nexus/

## Login

- The password for every user is "password"
- The users:
  ```
   admin1@uiu.ac.bd â€” admin
   admin2@uiu.ac.bd â€” admin
   alice.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   chris.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   nina.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   jamal.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   leena.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   omar.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   fatima.student@uiu.ac.bd â€” student
   bob.alumni@uiu.ac.bd â€” alumni
   diana.alumni@uiu.ac.bd â€” alumni
   karim.alumni@uiu.ac.bd â€” alumni
   sara.alumni@uiu.ac.bd â€” alumni
   rachel.recruiter@acme.example â€” recruiter
   victor.hr@globex.example â€” recruiter
   beta.hr@beta.example â€” recruiter
  ```

## Users / Admin

- New users can typically be registered through the web UI (registration page), or added directly in the users table in the database.
- Admin-level users should be created manually via DB or through any admin creation script included in the project.


## Troubleshooting

- If pages show database errors: check DB credentials in .env or config and that MySQL is running.
- If assets or JS/CSS are missing: confirm `public/` is the web root (or adjust Apache DocumentRoot).

For more details about the system and features, inspect the code under `app/Views/`, `app/Controllers/`, and the `nexus.sql` dump for sample data and account info.

# UIU Nexus â€“ Smart Alumni & Career Connection Platform

**UIU Nexus** is an integrated digital platform designed to connect **students, alumni, and recruiters** of **United International University (UIU)** within a single ecosystem. It serves as a **career development and community engagement hub**, promoting mentorship, collaboration, and professional growth.

Built with **PHP, MySQL, and minimal JavaScript**, the platform emphasizes **role-based access control (RBAC)**, **CRUD operations**, and a **reward-driven interaction model** (coins, badges, and reputation).

Quick start instructions for running this PHP project locally (XAMPP / Windows).

## Installation

1. Install XAMPP (Apache + MySQL) and Composer on Windows.
2. Place the project in XAMPP's htdocs (example path used here):
   - C:\xampp\htdocs\uiu-nexus
3. Install PHP dependencies (if any):
   ```powershell
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\uiu-nexus
   composer install
   ```
4. Create environment config:
   - Copy any environment example to a working config (if present):
   ```powershell
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   - Or edit app/Config/Database.php (or the project-specific config) to set DB credentials.

## Database setup

1. Start XAMPP Apache and MySQL.
2. Import the canonical SQL dump:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\uiu-nexus
   mysql -u root -p < nexus.sql
   ```
   (Replace `root` and `-p` usage with your DB user/password as required.)
3. Verify database credentials in your .env or config file.

## Usage

- Using XAMPP:
  - Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
  - Open the app in a browser:
    - http://localhost/uiu-nexus/ or http://127.0.0.1/uiu-nexus/
- Or use PHP built-in server (if supported by project):
  ```powershell
  cd C:\xampp\htdocs\uiu-nexus\public
  php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
  ```
  Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/

## Login

- The project may include sample users in `nexus.sql`. Check that file for sample usernames/passwords.
- If no sample admin exists, create one:
  - Use the app's registration flow (if present), or
  - Insert an admin user directly into the database (use a safe hashed password) or run any included seed script.
- After importing DB, update credentials as needed and rotate passwords for any sample accounts.

## Users / Admin

- New users can typically be registered through the web UI (registration page), or added directly in the users table in the database.
- Admin-level users should be created manually via DB or through any admin creation script included in the project.
- If the project provides an administrative panel, its URL and credentials are either documented in `nexus.sql` or created during setup.

## Git / Deployment notes

- A recommended `.gitignore` is present to exclude environment files, uploads, vendor/node_modules, and dumps:
  - Do not commit `.env`, private keys, uploads, or real DB dumps with sensitive data.
- Before pushing to GitHub, confirm `nexus.sql` is the single canonical dump you want tracked. Remove any sensitive or large files from history (use git-filter-repo or BFG if needed).

## Troubleshooting

- If pages show database errors: check DB credentials in .env or config and that MySQL is running.
- If assets or JS/CSS are missing: confirm `public/` is the web root (or adjust Apache DocumentRoot).

For more details about the system and features, inspect the code under `app/Views/`, `app/Controllers/`, and the `nexus.sql` dump for sample data and account info.
